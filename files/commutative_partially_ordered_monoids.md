=====Commutative partially ordered monoids=====

Abbreviation: **CPoMon**

====Definition====
A \emph{commutative partially ordered monoid} is a [[partially ordered monoid]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\cdot,1,\le\rangle$ such that

$\cdot$ is \emph{commutative}:  $xy=yx$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be commutative partially ordered monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$,
$h(1)=1$, and $x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$.

====Definition====
A \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
