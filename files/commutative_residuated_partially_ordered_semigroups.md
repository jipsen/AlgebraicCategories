=====Commutative residuated partially ordered semigroups=====

Abbreviation: **CRPoSgrp**

====Definition====
A \emph{commutative residuated partially ordered semigroup} is a [[residuated partially ordered semigroup]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A, \cdot, \to, \le\rangle$ such that

$\cdot$ is \emph{commutative}:  $xy=yx$

If you know something about this class, click on the ``Edit text of this page'' link at the bottom and fill out this page.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be commutative residuated partially ordered monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$,
$h(x \to y)=h(x) \to h(y)$, and $x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$.

====Definition====
A \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
