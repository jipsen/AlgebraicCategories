=====Commutative residuated partially ordered monoids=====

Abbreviation: **CRPoMon**

====Definition====
A \emph{commutative residuated partially ordered monoid} is a [[residuated partially ordered monoid]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A, \cdot, 1, \to, \le\rangle$ such that

$\cdot$ is \emph{commutative}:  $xy=yx$

Remark: These algebras are also known as \emph{lineales}.[(dePaiva2005)]

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be commutative residuated partially ordered monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$, $h(1)=1$,
$h(x \to y)=h(x) \to h(y)$, and $x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$.
