# Name of class

Abbreviation: **Abbr**

## Definition
A ***...*** is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,...\rangle$ is a [name of class](name_of_class.md)

$op_1$ is ***name of property***:  $axiom_1$

$op_2$ is ***...***:  $...$

If you know something about this class, click on the ``Edit text of this page'' link at the bottom and fill out this page.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

## Definition
A ***...*** is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
