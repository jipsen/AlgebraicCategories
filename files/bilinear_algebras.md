=====Bilinear algebras=====

Abbreviation: **BilinA**

====Definition====
A \emph{bilinear algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,+,-,0,\cdot,s_r\ (r\in F)\rangle$ of type $\langle 2,1,0,2,1_r\ (r\in F)\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,+,-,0,s_r\ (r\in F)\rangle$ is a [[vector space]] over a field $F$

$\cdot$ is \emph{bilinear}:  $x(y+z)=xy+xz$, $(x+y)z=xz+yz$, and $s_r(xy)=s_r(x)y=xs_r(y)$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
