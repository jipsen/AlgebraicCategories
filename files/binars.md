=====Binars=====

Abbreviation: **Bin**
====Definition====
A \emph{binar} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\cdot\rangle$ where
$\cdot$ is any binary operation on $A$.

Remark: In Universal Algebra binars are also called \emph{groupoids}. However the more common usage of this term now refers to a category in which each morphism is an isomorphism.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be binars. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
  
$h(x\cdot y)=h(x)\cdot h(y)$

====Examples====
Example 1: $\langle\mathbb N,{}^\wedge\rangle$ is the exponentiation binar of the natural numbers, where $0{}^\wedge0=1$. It is not associative nor commutative, and does not have a (two-sided) identity.
