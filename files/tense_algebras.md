=====Tense algebras=====

Abbreviation: **TA**

====Definition====
A \emph{tense algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\vee,0,
\wedge,1,\neg,\diamond_f, \diamond_p\rangle$ such that both


$\langle A,\vee,0,\wedge,1,\neg,\diamond_f\rangle$ and 
$\langle A,\vee,0,\wedge,1,\neg,\diamond_p\rangle$ are [[Modal algebras]]


$\diamond_p$ and $\diamond_f$ are \emph{conjugates}:  
$x\wedge\diamond_py = 0$ iff $\diamond_fx\wedge y = 0$


Remark: 
Tense algebras provide algebraic models for logic of tenses. The two possibility operators 
$\diamond_p$ and $\diamond_f$ are intuitively interpreted as
\emph{at some past instance} and \emph{at some future instance}. 


==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be tense algebras. 
A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\to B$ that is a Boolean homomorphism and preserves $\diamond_p$ and $\diamond_f$:

$h(\diamond x)=\diamond h(x)$
