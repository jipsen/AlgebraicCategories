=====Directed graphs=====

Abbreviation: **DiGraph**

====Definition====
A \emph{directed graph} (or \emph{digraph} for short) is a structure $\mathbf{G}=\langle G,E\rangle$ such that

$E$ is binary relation on $G$:  $E\subseteq G\times G$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ be directed graphs. A morphism from $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{H}$ is a function $h:G\rightarrow H$ that preserves $E$: 
$\langle x,y\rangle\in E^{\mathbf G}\Longrightarrow \langle h(x), h(y)\rangle\in E^{\mathbf H}$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
