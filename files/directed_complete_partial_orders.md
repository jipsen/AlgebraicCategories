# Directed complete partial orders

Abbreviation: **DCPO**
## Definition
A ***directed complete partial order*** is a poset $\mathbf{P}=\langle P,\leq \rangle$
such that every directed subset of $P$ has a least upper bound: 
$\forall D\subseteq P\ (D\ne\emptyset\text{and}\forall x,y\in D\ \exists z\in D
(x,y\le z)\Longrightarrow \exists z\in P(z=\bigvee D))$.
### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ be directed complete partial orders. A morphism from $\mathbf{P}$ to 
$\mathbf{Q}$ is a function $f:Parrow Q$ that is ***Scott-continuous***, which means that $f$ preserves all directed joins: 

$z=\bigvee D\Longrightarrow f(z)= \bigvee f[D]$

## Examples
Example 1: $\langle \mathbb{R},\leq \rangle$, the real numbers with the standard order.
Example 1: $\langle P(S),\subseteq \rangle$, the collection of subsets of a
sets $S$, ordered by inclusion.
