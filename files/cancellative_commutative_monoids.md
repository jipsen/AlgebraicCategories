=====Cancellative commutative monoids=====

Abbreviation: **CanCMon**
====Definition====
A \emph{cancellative commutative monoid} is a [[cancellative monoid]] $\mathbf{M}=\langle M,\cdot
,e\rangle $ such that

$\cdot $ is commutative:  $x\cdot y=y\cdot x$
==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ be cancellative commutative monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{M}$
to $\mathbf{N}$ is a function $h:Marrow N$ that is a homomorphism: 

$h(x\cdot y)=h(x)\cdot h(y)$, $h(e)=e$
====Examples====
Example 1: $\langle\mathbb{N},+,0\rangle$, the natural numbers, with addition and
zero. 


====Basic results====
All commutative free monoids are cancellative.

All finite commutative (left or right) cancellative monoids are reducts of [[abelian groups]].
