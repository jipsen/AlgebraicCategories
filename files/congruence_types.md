# Congruence Types

A ***minimal algebra*** is a finite nontrivial algebra in which every unary polynomial is either constant
or a permutation. 

Peter P. PÃ¡lfy, ***Unary polynomials in algebras. I***, Algebra Universalis, **18**, 1984, 262-273 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=86h:08001a|MRreview](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=86h:08001a|mrreviews.md) shows that if $\mathbf{M}$ is a
minimal algebra then $\mathbf{M}$ is polynomially equivalent to one of the following: 

  * a unary algebra in which each basic operation is a permutation
  * a vector space
  * the 2-element Boolean algebra
  * the 2-element lattice
  * a 2-element semilattice. 

The ***type*** of a minimal algebra $\mathbf{M}$ is defined
to be permutational (1), abelian (2), Boolean (3), lattice (4), or semilattice (5) accordingly. 

The type set of a finite algebra is defined and analyzed extensively in the groundbreaking book

With each two-element interval $\{\theta,\psi\}$ in the congruence lattice of a finite algebra the authors
associate a collection of minimal algebras of one of the 5 types, and this defines the value of $\text{typ}(\theta,\psi)$.

For a finite algebra $\mathbf{A}$, $\text{typ}(\mathbf{A})$ is the
union of the sets $\text{typ}(\theta,\psi)$ where $\{\theta,\psi\}$ ranges over all two-element intervals in the congruence lattice
of $\mathbf{A}$. For a class $\mathcal{K}$ of algebras, $\text{typ}(\mathcal{K}) = \{\text{typ}(\mathbf{A}): \mathbf{A} 
\text{ is a finite algebra in }\mathcal{K}\}$.
