=====Congruence Types=====

A \emph{minimal algebra} is a finite nontrivial algebra in which every unary polynomial is either constant
or a permutation. 

Peter P. PÃ¡lfy, \emph{Unary polynomials in algebras. I}, Algebra Universalis, \textbf{18}, 1984, 262-273 [[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=86h:08001a|MRreview]] shows that if $\mathbf{M}$ is a
minimal algebra then $\mathbf{M}$ is polynomially equivalent to one of the following: 

  * a unary algebra in which each basic operation is a permutation
  * a vector space
  * the 2-element Boolean algebra
  * the 2-element lattice
  * a 2-element semilattice. 

The \emph{type} of a minimal algebra $\mathbf{M}$ is defined
to be permutational (1), abelian (2), Boolean (3), lattice (4), or semilattice (5) accordingly. 

The type set of a finite algebra is defined and analyzed extensively in the groundbreaking book

With each two-element interval $\{\theta,\psi\}$ in the congruence lattice of a finite algebra the authors
associate a collection of minimal algebras of one of the 5 types, and this defines the value of $\mbox{typ}(\theta,\psi)$.

For a finite algebra $\mathbf{A}$, $\mbox{typ}(\mathbf{A})$ is the
union of the sets $\mbox{typ}(\theta,\psi)$ where $\{\theta,\psi\}$ ranges over all two-element intervals in the congruence lattice
of $\mathbf{A}$. For a class $\mathcal{K}$ of algebras, $\mbox{typ}(\mathcal{K}) = \{\mbox{typ}(\mathbf{A}): \mathbf{A} 
\mbox{ is a finite algebra in }\mathcal{K}\}$.
