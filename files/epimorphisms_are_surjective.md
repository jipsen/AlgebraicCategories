# Epimorphisms are surjective

A morphism $h$ in a category is an ***epimorphism*** if it is right-cancellative, i.e. for all 
morphisms $f$, $g$ in the category $f\circ h=g\circ h$ implies $f=g$.

A function $h:A\to B$ is ***surjective*** (or ***onto***) if $B=f[A]=\{f(a): a\in A\}$, 
i.e., for all $b\in B$ there exists $a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$.

***Epimorphisms are surjective*** in a (concrete) category of structures if the underlying function of every epimorphism is surjective.

If a concrete category has the [amalgamation property](amalgamation_propertys.md) and all epimorphisms are surjective, then it has the [strong amalgamation property](strong_amalgamation_propertys.md)[E.
