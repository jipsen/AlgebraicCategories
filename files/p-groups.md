=====P-groups=====

Abbreviation: **p-Grp**

====Definition====
A \emph{$p$-group} is a [[group]] $\mathbf{G}=\langle G, \cdot, ^{-1}, 1\rangle$ such that

$p$ is a prime number and $\forall x\exists n\in\mathbb N(x^{(p^n)}=1)$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be $p$-groups. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
