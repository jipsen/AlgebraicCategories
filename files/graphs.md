=====Graphs=====

Abbreviation: **Gph**

====Definition====
A \emph{graph} is a structure $\mathbf{G}=\langle G, E\rangle$ such that 

$G$ is a set, 

$E$ is a binary relation on $G$: $E\subseteq G\times G$, and 

$E$ is symmetric:  $xEy\Longrightarrow yEx$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ be graphs. A morphism from $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{H}$ is a function $h:G\rightarrow H$ that is a homomorphism: 
$xE^{\mathbf G}y\Longrightarrow h(x)\,E^{\mathbf H}\,h(y)$.
