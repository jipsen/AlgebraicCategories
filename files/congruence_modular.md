# Congruence modularity

An algebra is ***congruence modular*** (or CM for short) if its lattice of congruence relations is [modular lattices|modular](modular_lattices|modulars.md).

A class of algebras is ***congruence modular*** if each of its members is congruence modular.

Congruence modularity holds for many 'classical' varieties such as groups and rings.

A Mal'cev condition (with 4-ary terms) for congruence modularity is given by Alan Day, ***A characterization of modularity for congruence lattices of algebras.***, 
Canad. Math. Bull., **12**, 1969, 167-173 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=40:1317|MRreview](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=40:1317|mrreviews.md)

Another Mal'cev condition (with ternary terms) for congruence modularity is given by H.-Peter Gumm, ***Congruence modularity is permutability composed with distributivity***, 
Arch. Math. (Basel), **36**, 1981, 569-576 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=82j:08009|MRreview](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=82j:08009|mrreviews.md)

Several further characterizations are given by Steven T. Tschantz, ***More conditions equivalent to congruence modularity***,
