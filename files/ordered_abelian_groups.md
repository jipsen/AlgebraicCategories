=====Ordered abelian groups=====

Abbreviation: **OGrp**

====Definition====
An \emph{ordered abelian group} is an [[ordered group]] $\mathbf{G}=\langle G,+,-,0,\le\rangle$ such that

$+$ is \emph{commutative}:  $x+y=y+x$

Remark: This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ordered groups. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x + y)=h(x) + h(y)$,
$x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$.

====Definition====
A \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
