=====Modal algebras=====

Abbreviation: **MA**

====Definition====
A \emph{modal algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\vee,0,
\wedge,1,\neg,\diamond\rangle$ such that


$\langle A,\vee,0,
\wedge,1,\neg\rangle $ is a [[Boolean algebras]]


$\diamond$ is \emph{join-preserving}:  
$\diamond(x\vee y)=\diamond x\vee \diamond y$


$\diamond$ is \emph{normal}:  
$\diamond 0=0$

Remark: 
Modal algebras provide algebraic models for modal logic. The operator $\diamond$ is the
\emph{possibility operator}, and the \emph{necessity operator} $\Box$ is defined as $\Box x=\neg\diamond\neg x$.


==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be modal algebras. 
A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\to B$ that is a Boolean homomorphism and preserves $\diamond$:

$h(\diamond x)=\diamond h(x)$
