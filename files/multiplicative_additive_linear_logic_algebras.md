=====Multiplicative additive linear logic algebras=====

Abbreviation: **MALLA**

====Definition====
A \emph{multiplicative additive linear logic algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\vee,\bot,\wedge,\top,+,0,\cdot,1,^\perp\rangle$ of type $\langle
2,0,2,0,2,0,1\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,\vee,\wedge,\cdot,1,^{\perp}\rangle$ is a [[commutative involutive residuated lattice]]

$\bot$ is the least element:  $\bot\le x$

$\top$ is the greatest element:  $x\le\top$

$+$ is the dual of $\cdot$: $x+y=(x^\perp\cdot y^\perp)^\perp$

$0$ is the dual of $1$: $0=1^\perp$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be multiplicative additive linear logic algebras. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism.

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
