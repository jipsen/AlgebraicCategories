=====Residuated partially ordered monoids=====

Abbreviation: **RpoMon**

====Definition====
A \emph{residuated partially ordered monoid} (or \emph{rpo-monoid}) is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\le,\cdot,1,\backslash,/\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,\le\rangle$ is a [[partially ordered set]],

$\langle A,\cdot,1\rangle$ is a [[monoid]] and

$\backslash$ is the left residual of $\cdot$:  $x\cdot y\le z\iff y\le x\backslash z$

$/$ is the right residual of $\cdot$:  $x\cdot y\le z\iff x\le z/y$.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be residuated po-monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is an order-preserving homomorphism: 
$x\le y\implies h(x)\le h(y)$, $h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$, $h(x \backslash y)=h(x) \backslash h(y)$, $h(x / y)=h(x) / h(y)$.
