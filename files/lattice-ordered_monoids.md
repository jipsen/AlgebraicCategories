=====Lattice-ordered monoids=====

Abbreviation: **LMon**

====Definition====
A \emph{lattice-ordered monoid} (or \emph{$\ell$-monoid}) is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A\vee,\wedge,\cdot,1\rangle$ of type $\langle 2,2,2,0\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,\vee,\wedge\rangle$ is a [[lattice]]

$\langle A,\cdot,1\rangle$ is a [[monoid]]

$\cdot$ distributes over $\vee$:  $x(y\vee z)=xy\vee xz$, $(x\vee y)z=xz\vee yz$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be lattice ordered monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x \vee y)=h(x) \vee h(y)$,
$h(x \wedge y)=h(x) \wedge h(y)$,
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$,
$h(1)=1$.
