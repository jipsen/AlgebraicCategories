=====Schroeder categories=====

Abbreviation: **SchrCat**

====Definition====
A \emph{Schroeder category} is an enriched [[category]] $\mathbf{C}=\langle C,\circ,\text{dom},\text{cod}\rangle$

in which every hom-set is a Boolean algebras.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{D}$ be Schroeder categories. A morphism from $\mathbf{C}$ to $\mathbf{D}$ is a function $h:C\rightarrow D$ that is a \emph{functor}: $h(x\circ y)=h(x)\circ h(y)$, $h(\text{dom}(x))=\text{dom}(h(x))$ and $h(\text{cod}(x))=\text{cod}(h(x))$.

Remark: These categories are also called \emph{groupoids}.
