=====Cancellative monoids=====

Abbreviation: **CanMon**
====Definition====
A \emph{cancellative monoid} is a [[monoid]] $\mathbf{M}=\langle M, \cdot, e\rangle$ such that

$\cdot $ is left cancellative:  $z\cdot x=z\cdot y\Longrightarrow x=y$

$\cdot $ is right cancellative:  $x\cdot z=y\cdot z\Longrightarrow x=y$

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ be cancellative monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{M}$
to $\mathbf{N}$ is a function $h:M\rightarrow N$ that is a homomorphism: 

$h(x\cdot y)=h(x)\cdot h(y)$, $h(e)=e$

====Examples====
Example 1: $\langle\mathbb{N},+,0\rangle$, the natural numbers, with addition and
zero. 


====Basic results====
All free monoids are cancellative.

All finite (left or right) cancellative monoids are reducts of [[groups]].
