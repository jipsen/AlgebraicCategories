=====Near-fields=====

Abbreviation: **NFld**
====Definition====
A \emph{near-field} is a [[near-rings with identity]] $\mathbf{N}=\langle N,+,-,0,\cdot,1
\rangle $ such that


$\mathbf{N}$ is non-trivial:  $0\ne 1$


every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse:  $x\ne 0\Longrightarrow \exists y 
(x\cdot y=1)$

Remark: 
The inverse of $x$ is unique, and is usually denoted by $x^{-1}$.


==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ be near-fields. A morphism from $\mathbf{M}$
to $\mathbf{N}$ is a function $h:M\rightarrow N$ that is a homomorphism: 

$h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)$, $h(x\cdot y)=h(x)\cdot h(y)$

Remark: 
It follows that $h(0)=0$ and $h(-x)=-h(x)$.

====Examples====
Example 1: 

====Basic results====
$0$ is a zero for $\cdot$: $0\cdot x=0$ and $x\cdot 0=0$.
