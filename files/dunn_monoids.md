=====Dunn monoid=====

Abbreviation: **DunnMon**

====Definition====
A \emph{Dunn monoid} is a [[commutative distributive residuated lattice]] $\mathbf{L}=\langle L, \vee, \wedge, \cdot, e, \to \rangle$ such that


$\cdot$ is square-increasing:  $x\le x^2$


Remark: Here $x^2=x\cdot x$. These algebras were first defined by J.M.Dunn in [(Du1966)] and were named by R.K. Meyer[(Me1972)].

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ be Dunn monoids. A
morphism from $\mathbf{L}$ to $\mathbf{M}$ is a function $h:L\rightarrow M$
that is a homomorphism: 

$h(x\vee y)=h(x)\vee h(y)$, $h(x\wedge y)=h(x)\wedge h(y)$,
$h(x\cdot y)=h(x)\cdot h(y)$, $h(x\to y)=h(x)\to h(y)$, and $h(e)=e$
