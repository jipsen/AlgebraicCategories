# M-sets

Abbreviation: **MSet**

## Definition
An ***$\mathbf M$-set*** is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,f_m (m\in M)\rangle$, where $\mathbf M=\langle
M,\cdot,1\rangle$ is a [monoid](monoids.md), such that

$f_1$ is the identity map:  $1x=x$ and

the monoid action associates:  $(m\cdot n)x=m(nx)$

Remark: 
$f_m(x)=mx$ is a unary operation called ***the monoid action by $m$***.

This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be $\mathbf M$-sets. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(f_m^{\mathbf A}(x))=f_m^{mathbf B}(h(x))$.
