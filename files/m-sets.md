=====M-sets=====

Abbreviation: **MSet**

====Definition====
An \emph{$\mathbf M$-set} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,f_m (m\in M)\rangle$, where $\mathbf M=\langle
M,\cdot,1\rangle$ is a [[monoid]], such that

$f_1$ is the identity map:  $1x=x$ and

the monoid action associates:  $(m\cdot n)x=m(nx)$

Remark: 
$f_m(x)=mx$ is a unary operation called \emph{the monoid action by $m$}.

This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be $\mathbf M$-sets. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(f_m^{\mathbf A}(x))=f_m^{mathbf B}(h(x))$.

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
