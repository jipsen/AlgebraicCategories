=====Nilpotent groups=====

Abbreviation: **NGrp**

====Definition====
A \emph{nilpotent group} is a [[group]] $\mathbf{G}=\langle G,\cdot,^{-1},1\rangle$ that is

\emph{nilpotent}:  if $Z_0=\{1\}$ and $\forall i(Z_{i+1}=\{x \in G : \forall y\ xyx^{-1}y^{-1} \in Z_i\})$ then $\exists n(Z_n=G)$

Remark: Note that $Z_1=Z(G)$, the center of $G$. The smallest $n$ for which $Z_n=G$ is the \emph{nilpotence class of $G$}. E.g. Abelian
groups are of nilpotence class 1.

This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be nilpotent groups. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
