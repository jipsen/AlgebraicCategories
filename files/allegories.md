=====Allegories=====

Abbreviation: **All**

====Definition====
An \emph{allegory} is an expanded [[category]] $\mathbf{M}=\langle M,\circ,\text{dom},\text{rng},\text{id},\vee,\wedge,^\smile\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $...$

$...$ is ...:  $...$

Remark: This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be allegories. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a functor $F:A\rightarrow B$ that also preserves the
new operations: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
