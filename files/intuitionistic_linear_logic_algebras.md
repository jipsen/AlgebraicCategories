=====Intuitionistic linear logic algebras=====

Abbreviation: **ILLA**

====Definition====
An \emph{intuitionistic linear logic algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\vee, \bot, \wedge, \top, \cdot, 1, \backslash, /, 0, !\rangle$ of type $\langle 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,\vee, \wedge, \cdot, 1, \backslash, /, 0\rangle$ is a [[FL-algebra]]

$\bot$ is the least element:  $\bot\le x$

$\top$ is the greatest element:  $x\le \top$

$!$ is a closure operator:

$!$ satisfies ...:

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
