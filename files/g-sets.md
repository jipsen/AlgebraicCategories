=====G-sets=====

Abbreviation: **Gset**

====Definition====
A \emph{G-set} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,f_g (g\in G)\rangle$, where $\langle G, \cdot, ^{-1}, 1\rangle$ is a [[group]], such that

$f_1$ is the identity map:  $1x=x$ and

the group action associates:  $(g\cdot h)x=g(hx)$

Remark: 
$f_g(x)=gx$ is a unary operation called \emph{the group action by $g$}.

If follows from the associativity that
$f_{g^{-1}}$ is the inverse function of $f_g$.

This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
