# Congruence distributivity

An algebra is ***congruence distributive*** (or CD for short) if its lattice of congruence relations is a [distributive lattices|distributive lattice](distributive_lattices|distributive_lattices.md).

A class of algebras is ***congruence distributive*** if each of its members is congruence distributive.

Congruence distributivity has many structural consequences. The most striking one is perhaps Jónsson's Lemma [(Bjarni Jónsson, ***Algebras whose congruence lattices are distributive***,
Math. Scand., **21**, 1967, 110--121 [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=38:5689|MRreview](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=38:5689|mrreviews.md))] which implies that a finitely
generated CD variety is residually finite.
