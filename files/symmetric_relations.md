# Symmetric relations

Abbreviation: **SymRel**

## Definition
A ***symmetric relation*** is a structure $\mathbf{X}=\langle X,R\rangle$ such that $R$ is a ***binary relation on $X$*** 
(i.e. $R\subseteq X\times X$) that
is

symmetric:  $xRy\Longrightarrow yRx$

Remark: This is a template.
If you know something about this class, click on the ``Edit text of this page'' link at the bottom and fill out this page.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ be symmetric relations. A morphism from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{Y}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$xR^{\mathbf X} y\Longrightarrow h(x)R^{\mathbf Y}h(y)$
