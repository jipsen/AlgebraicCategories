=====Symmetric relations=====

Abbreviation: **SymRel**

====Definition====
A \emph{symmetric relation} is a structure $\mathbf{X}=\langle X,R\rangle$ such that $R$ is a \emph{binary relation on $X$} 
(i.e. $R\subseteq X\times X$) that
is

symmetric:  $xRy\Longrightarrow yRx$

Remark: This is a template.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ be symmetric relations. A morphism from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{Y}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$xR^{\mathbf X} y\Longrightarrow h(x)R^{\mathbf Y}h(y)$
