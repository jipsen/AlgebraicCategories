=====Monoidal t-norm logic algebras=====

Abbreviation: **MTLA**

====Definition====
A \emph{monoidal t-norm logic algebra} is a [[FLew-algebra]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A, \vee, \wedge, \cdot, 1, \to, 0\rangle$ such that

$\cdot$ is \emph{prelinear}:  $(x\to y)\vee (y\to x)=1$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be monoidal t-norm logic algebras. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x \vee y)=h(x) \vee h(y)$,
$h(x \wedge y)=h(x) \wedge h(y)$,
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$,
$h(x \to y)=h(x) \to h(y)$,
$h(0)=0$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
