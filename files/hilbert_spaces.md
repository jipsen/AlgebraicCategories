=====Hilbert spaces=====

Abbreviation: **Hilb**
====Definition====
A \emph{Hilbert space} is a [[vector spaces]] $\mathbf{H}$ with inner product $\langle\cdot , \cdot\rangle$,
which is complete in the corresponding metric.

  
Remark: 
  
==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{H_1}$ and $\mathbf{H_2}$ be two Hilbert spaces. A morphism from $\mathbf{H_1}$ to $\mathbf{H_2}$ is a bounded operator $T:H_1\rightarrow H_2$.
