=====Boolean lattices=====

Abbreviation: **BoolLat**
====Definition====
A \emph{Boolean lattice} is a 
[[bounded distributive lattice]] 
$\mathbf{L}=\langle L,\vee ,0,\wedge ,1\rangle $ such that

every element has a complement:  $\exists y(x\vee y=1\mbox{ and }x\wedge y=0)$

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{M}$ be bounded distributive lattices. 
A morphism from $\mathbf{L}$ to $\mathbf{M}$ is a function $h:L\to M$ that is a
bounded lattice homomorphism: 

$h(x\vee y)=h(x)\vee h(y)$, $h(x\wedge y)=h(x)\wedge h(y)$, $h(0)=0 $, $h(1)=1$

====Examples====
Example 1: $\langle \mathcal P(S), \cup, \emptyset, \cap, S\rangle$, the collection
of subsets of a set $S$, with union, empty set, intersection, and the whole
set $S$.
