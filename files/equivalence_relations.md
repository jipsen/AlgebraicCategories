# Equivalence relations

Abbreviation: **EqRel**

## Definition
An ***equivalence relation*** is a structure $\mathbf{X}=\langle X,\equiv\rangle$ such that $\equiv$ is a ***binary relation on $X$*** 
(i.e. $\equiv\ \subseteq X\times X$) that
is

reflexive:  $x\equiv x$

symmetric:  $x\equiv y\Longrightarrow y\equiv x$

transitive: $x\equiv y\text{ and }y\equiv z\Longrightarrow x\equiv z$

Remark: This is a template.
If you know something about this class, click on the ``Edit text of this page'' link at the bottom and fill out this page.

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ be equivalence relations. A morphism from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{Y}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$x\equiv^{\mathbf X} y\Longrightarrow h(x)\equiv^{\mathbf Y}h(y)$

## Definition
An ***equivalence relation*** is a [qoset](qosets.md) that is ***symmetric***: $x\equiv y\Longrightarrow y\equiv x$

## Examples
Example 1: 

## Basic results
Equivalence relations are in 1-1 correspondence with [partitions](partitions.md).
