=====Ordered fields=====

Abbreviation: **OFld**

====Definition====
An \emph{ordered field} is a structure $\mathbf{F}=\langle F,+,-,0,\cdot,1,\le\rangle$ such that

$\langle F,+,-,0,\cdot,1\rangle$ is a [[field]]

$\langle F,\le\rangle$ is a [[linear order]]

$+$ is \emph{order-preserving}: $x\le y\Longrightarrow x+z\le y+z$

$\cdot$ is \emph{order-preserving} for positive elements: $x\le y\text{ and }0\le z\Longrightarrow xz\le yz$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
