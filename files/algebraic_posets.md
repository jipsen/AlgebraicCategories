# Algebraic posets

Abbreviation: **APos**

## Definition
An ***algebraic poset*** is a [directed complete partial orders](directed_complete_partial_orders.md) $\mathbf{P}=\langle P,\leq \rangle$
such that

the set of compact elements below any element is directed and

every element is the join of all compact elements below it.

An element $c\in P$ is ***compact*** if for every subset $S\subseteq P$ such that $c\le\bigvee S$, there exists
a finite subset $S_0$ of $S$ such that $c\le\bigvee S_0$.

The set of compact elements of $P$ is denoted by $K(P)$.

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ be algebraic posets. A morphism from $\mathbf{P}$ to 
$\mathbf{Q}$ is a function $f:P\rightarrow Q$ that is ***Scott-continuous***, which means that $f$ preserves all directed joins: 

$z=\bigvee D\Longrightarrow f(z)= \bigvee f[D]$
