=====Ordered monoids with zero=====

Abbreviation: **OMonZ**

====Definition====
An \emph{ordered monoid with zero} is of the form $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\cdot,1,0,\le\rangle$ such that $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\cdot,1,\le\rangle$ is an [[ordered monoid]] and

$0$ is a \emph{zero}:  $x\cdot 0 = 0$ and $0\cdot x = 0$

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ordered monoids. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$, 
$h(1)=1$,
$h(0)=0$,
$x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$.
