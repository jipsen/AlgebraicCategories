=====Multiplicative lattices=====

Abbreviation: **MultLat**

====Definition====
A \emph{multiplicative lattice} (or \emph{$m$-lattice}) is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\vee,\wedge,\cdot\rangle$ of type $\langle 2,2,2\rangle$ such that

$\langle A,\vee,\wedge\rangle$ is a [[lattice]]

$\cdot$ distributes over $\vee$:  $x(y\vee z)=xy\vee xz$, $(x\vee y)z=xz\vee yz$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
