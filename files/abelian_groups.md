# Abelian groups

Abbreviation: **AbGrp** [[wp>Abelian group]]

## Definition
An ***abelian group*** is a structure $\mathbf{G}=\langle
G,+,-,0\rangle$, where $+$ is an infix binary operation, called the 
\emph{group addition}, $-$ is a prefix unary operation, called the 
\emph{group negative} and $0$ is a constant (nullary operation), called the \emph{additive identity element}, such that

$+$ is commutative:  $x+y=y+x$

$+$ is associative:  $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$

$0$ is an additive identity for $+$:  $0+x=x$

$-$ gives an additive inverse for $+$:  $-x+x=0$

### Morphisms
Let $\mathbf{G}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ be abelian groups. A morphism from $\mathbf{G}$ to $\mathbf{H}$ is a function $h:G\rightarrow H$ that is a
homomorphism: 
$h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y)$

Remark: It follows that $h(-x)= -h(x)$ and $h(0)=0$.


## Examples
Example 1: $\langle \mathbb{Z}, +, -, 0\rangle$, the integers, with addition, unary subtraction, and zero. The variety of abelian groups is generated by this algebra.

Example 2: $\mathbb Z_n=\langle \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb Z, +_n, -_n, 0+n\mathbb Z\rangle$, integers mod $n$.

Example 3: Any one-generated subgroup of a group.


## Basic results
The free abelian group on $n$ generators is $\mathbb Z^n$.

Classification of finitely generated abelian groups: Every $n$-generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of $\mathbb Z_{p_i^{k_i}}$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$ and $n-m$ copies of $\mathbb Z$, where the $p_i$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes and $m\ge 0$.
