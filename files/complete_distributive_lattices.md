=====Complete distributive lattices=====

Abbreviation: **CDLat**

====Definition====
A \emph{complete distributive lattice} is a [[complete lattice]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,\bigvee,\bigwedge\rangle$ such that

$\vee$ distributes over $\wedge$:  $x\vee (y\wedge z)=(x\vee y)\wedge(x\vee z)$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
