=====Frames=====

Abbreviation: **Frm**

====Definition====
A \emph{frame} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A, \bigvee, \wedge, e, 0\rangle$ of type $\langle\infty, 2, 0, 0\rangle$ such that

$\langle A, \bigvee, 0\rangle$ is a [[complete semilattice]] with $0=\bigvee\emptyset$,

$\langle A, \wedge, e\rangle$ is a [[meet semilattice with identity]], and

$\wedge$ distributes over $\bigvee$:  $x\wedge(\bigvee Y)=\bigvee_{y\in Y}(x\wedge y)$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be frames. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(\bigvee X)=\bigvee h[X]$ for all $X\subseteq A$ (hence $h(0)=0$),
$h(x \wedge y)=h(x) \wedge h(y)$ and
$h(e)=e$.

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
