=====Cylindric algebras=====

Abbreviation: **CA$_\alpha$**

====Definition====
A \emph{cylindric algebra} of dimension $\alpha$ is a [[Boolean algebra with operators]] $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,
\vee, 0, \wedge, 1, -, c_i, d_{ij}: i,j<\alpha\rangle$ such that for all $i,j<\alpha$

the $c_i$ are increasing: $x\le c_i x$

the $c_i$ semi-distribute over $\wedge$: $c_i(x\wedge c_i y) = c_i x\wedge c_i y$

the $c_i$ commute: $c_ic_j x=c_jc_i x$

the diagonals $d_{ii}$ equal the top element:  $d_{ii}=1$

$d_{ij}=c_k(d_{ik}\wedge d_{kj})$ for $k\ne i,j$

$c_i(d_{ij}\wedge x)\wedge c_i(d_{ij}\wedge -x)=0$ for $i\ne j$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be ... . A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(x ... y)=h(x) ... h(y)$

====Definition====
An \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
