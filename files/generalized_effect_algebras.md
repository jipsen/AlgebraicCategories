=====Generalized effect algebras=====

Abbreviation: **GEAlg**

====Definition====
A \emph{generalized effect algebra} is a [[separation algebra]] that is

\emph{positive}: $x\cdot y=e$ implies $x=e=y$.

====Definition====
A \emph{generalized effect algebra} is of the form $\langle A,+,0\rangle$ where $+:A^2\to A\cup\{*\}$ is a partial operation such that

$+$ is \emph{commutative}: $x+y\ne *$ implies $x+y=y+x$

$+$ is \emph{associative}: $x+y\ne *$ implies $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z)$

$0$ is an \emph{identity}: $x+0=x$

$+$ is \emph{cancellative}: $x+y=x+z$ implies $y=z$ and

$+$ is \emph{positive}: $x+y=0$ implies $x=0$.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be generalized effect algebra. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(e)=e$ and
if $x + y\ne *$ then $h(x + y)=h(x) + h(y)$.
