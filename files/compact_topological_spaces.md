=====Compact topological spaces=====

Abbreviation: **KTop**

====Definition====
A \emph{compact topological space} is a [[topological space]] $\mathbf{X}=\langle X,\Omega\rangle$ that is

\emph{compact}: every open cover has a finite subcover, i.e.,
$\forall\mathcal C\subseteq\Omega(\bigcup\mathcal C=X\Longrightarrow\exists n, \exists C_0,\ldots,C_{n-1}\in\mathcal C(C_0\cup\cdots\cup C_{n-1}=X))$

It is not unusual to give several (equivalent) definitions. Ideally, one of the definitions would give an irredundant axiomatization that does not refer to other classes.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ be compact topological spaces. A morphism from $\mathbf{X}$ to $\mathbf{Y}$ is a function $h:X\rightarrow Y$ that is a continuous: 
$\forall V\in\Omega_{\mathbf Y}(h^{-1}[Y]\in\Omega_{\mathbf X})$

====Definition====
A \emph{...} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,...\rangle$ of type $\langle
...\rangle$ such that

$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
  
$...$ is ...:  $axiom$
