===== Unary Algebras =====

Abbreviation: **Unar**

====Definition====
A \emph{unary algebra} is a structure $\mathbf{A}=\langle A,(f_i:\in I)\rangle$ of type $\langle 1: i\in I\rangle$ such that
$f_i$ is a unary operation on $A$ for all $i\in I$.

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be unary algebras over the same index set $I$. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is a homomorphism: 
$h(f_i(x))=f_i(h(x))$ for all $i\in I$.

====Examples====
Example 1: The free unary algebra on one generator is isomorphic to $I^*$, the set of all $n$-tuples of $I$ for $n\in\omega$. The empty tuple is the generator $x$, and the operations $f_i$ are defined by $f_i((i_1,\ldots,i_n))=(i,i_1,\ldots,i_n)$.

The free unary algebra on $X$ generators is a union of $|X|$ disjoint copies of the one-generated free algebra.
