=====Congruence uniformity=====

An algebra is \emph{congruence uniform} if for all congruence relations $\theta$ of the algebra it holds that
all congruence classes of $\theta$ have the same cardinality.

A class of algebras is \emph{congruence uniform} if each of its members is congruence uniform. 

Congruence uniformity holds for many 'classical' varieties such as groups, rings and vector spaces. 

This property can be characterized by a Mal'cev condition ...
