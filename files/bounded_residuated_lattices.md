=====Bounded residuated lattices=====

Abbreviation: **RLat$_b$**

====Definition====
A \emph{bounded residuated lattice} is a [[residuated lattice]]
that is bounded:

$\bot$ is the least element:  $\bot\vee x=x$

$\top$ is the greatest element:  $\top\vee x=\top$

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be bounded residuated lattices. 
A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a residuated lattice homomorphism $h:A\rightarrow B$ that preserves the bounds: 
$h(\bot)=\bot$ and $h(\top)=\top$.
