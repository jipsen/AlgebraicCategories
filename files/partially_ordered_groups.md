=====Partially ordered groups=====

Abbreviation: **PoGrp**

====Definition====
A \emph{partially ordered group} is a structure $\mathbf{G}=\langle G,\cdot,^{-1},1,\le\rangle$ such that

$\langle G,\cdot,^{-1},1\rangle$ is a [[group]]

$\langle G,\le\rangle$ is a [[partially ordered set]]

$\cdot$ is \emph{orderpreserving}:  $x\le y\Longrightarrow wxz\le wyz$

==Morphisms==
Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be partially ordered groups. A morphism from $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{B}$ is a function $h:A\rightarrow B$ that is an orderpreserving homomorphism: 
$h(x \cdot y)=h(x) \cdot h(y)$,
$x\le y\Longrightarrow h(x)\le h(y)$

====Examples====
Example 1: The integers, the rationals and the reals with the usual order.

====Basic results====

Any [[group]] is a partially ordered group with equality as partial order.

Any finite partially ordered group has only the equality relation as partial order.
